### Setup requirements.

In order to run the project, it will require:

1. Run the NPM install command
2. Add the supabase api password and URL in file supbase.ts
3. Add the TMDb api  key in env (variable VITE_TMDB_KEY=)
4. Create the tables in supabase using the commands

CREATE TABLE favorites (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    movie_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    image_url TEXT,
    rating NUMERIC,
    title TEXT,
    overview TEXT,
    popularity NUMERIC,
    release_date DATE,
    vote_count INT
);

CREATE TABLE myfantasymovie (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    overview TEXT,
    genre TEXT,
    runtime INTEGER,
    director TEXT,
    budget NUMERIC,
    poster TEXT,
    cast JSONB
);

Create a bucket called posters
